Compute the maximum number of dichotomies, $m_\mathcal{H}\left(N\right)$, for thise learning models, and consequently compute $d_{VC}$, the VC dimension.

(a) Positive or negative ray:  $\mathcal{H}$ contains the functions which are +1 on $\left[a,\infty\right)$ (for some a), together with those that are +1 on $\left(-\infty,a\right]$ (for some a).

$m_\mathcal{H}\left(N\right) = 2N + 1$ dichotomies

(b) Positive or negative interval.  $\mathcal{H}$ contains the functions which are +1 on an interval $\left[a,b\right]$ and -1 elsewhere, or -1 on an interval $\left[a,b\right]$ and +1 elsewhere.

$m_\mathcal{H}\left(N\right) = {N+1 \choose 2} + 1 = N^2 + N + 1$ dichotomies
