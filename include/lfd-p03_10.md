(b) Show that the trace of a symmetic matrix equals the sum of its eigen-values.  [Hint:  Use the spectral theorem and the cyclic property of the trace.  Note that the same result holds for non-symmetric matrices, but is a little harder to prove.]

$c_k = \frac{-1}{k}TR\left(A B_{k-1}\right)$ and $B_0 = I$ , so for $k=1$ $c_1 = TR\left(A B_0\right) = TR\left(A I \right) = TR\left(A\right).$
