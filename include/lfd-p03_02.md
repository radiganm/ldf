# Problem 3.2


For the double-semi-circle task in Problem 3.1, vary *sep* in the range {0.2, 0.4, ..., 0.5}.  Generate 2,000 examples and run the PLA starting with **w = 0**.  Record the number of interations PLA takes to converge.

Plot *sep* versus the number of iterations PLA takes to converge.  Explain your observations *[Hint: Problem 1.3.]*
