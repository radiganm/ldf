# Problem 3.1


Consider the double semi-circle "toy" learning task below (see figure).  There are two semi-circles of width *thk* with inner radius *rad*, separated by *sep* as shown (red is -1, blue is +1).  The center of the top semi-circle is linearly separable when $sep \ge 0$, and not so for $sep < 0$.  Set *rad* = 10, *thk* = 5, and sep = 5.  Then, generate 2e3 examples uniformly, which means you will have approximately 1e3 examples for each class.

(a) Run the PLA starting from w = 0 until it converges.  Plot the data and final hypothesis.

(b) Repeat part (a) using the linear regression (for classification) to obtain w.  Explain your observations.
